## About

Hypertype is a minimalistic typing test. It tests your typing speed with randomly generated words using Faker.js, while providing accurate calculations of WPM, CPM, and accuracy.

## Development

The web app is built with TypeScript and React.js (CRA). To run or build the app yourself, you need Node.js and npm installed.
